# PSE-Project
Project as part of Principles of Software Engineering course, @IIT Palakkad.

# Interactive Learner
An application that facilitates interaction between multiple students and a teacher. 

# Plan:
- Each team will have a dedicated folder. DO NOT make changes to the files that belong to folders other than yours.
- Each team lead would fork this repository and the members could then fork the fork.
- Only team leads' merge requests will be entertained after approval from the Q&A team.
